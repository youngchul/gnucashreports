GnuCashReports generates financial statements from a GnuCash file. It runs on
Google App Engine.

A personal financial statement consists of a balance sheet and an income
statement. A balance sheet is a list of what you own and what you owe at a
particular moment in time (net worth = assets - liabilities). An income
statement is a list of what money you earned and what money you spent over a
period of time (net income = income - expenses).
